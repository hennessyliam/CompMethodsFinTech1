\f2\fs20 \cf0  Chris Edwards[1] 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This Cato study[2] examines wealthy people funding startup businesses. Since the early industrial revolution, angels have been investing in highly risky businesses that financial institutions such as banks won't touch. Most such investments fail, but angels occasionally launch arevolution. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Steve Wozniak is one of the heroes of America's high\uc0\u8208 \u8203 tech boom. He designed the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  1and 2computers and co\uc0\u8208 \u8203 founded 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Computer with Steve Jobs. In the Cato study, Inote that Mike Markkula was the angel who gave young and broke Wozniak and Jobs the money to launch their pathbreaking firm. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 So Iwas interested to find this 2011 interview[3] with Wozniak describing the importance of Markkula. At 15:54: 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The story of 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is alittle misunderstood because it's like Steve and Idid it ourselves. And really, with the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  2computer, we got funding. Aguy funded us, an angel. And he joined us. He had made his money working in marketing at Intel and as an engineer before, and he was amentor. He was kind of young, but he was wealthy and he owned as much of 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  as Steve and Idid. Same amount of stock. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Mike Markkula was his name. And he ran our marketing, but he was our mentor. He told us how we would organize the company\'97what Steve's roles would be, what my role would be. So he was really more responsible for 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's success than anyone. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 [Markkula] kind of lays out of the picture because Steve and Icame from nothing. We had no savings account. We had no relatives or friends who could loan us money. We just had this drive, we wanted to build this computer, wanted to find away to sell it. And for awhile, we were getting the parts on 30\uc0\u8208 \u8203 day credit, with no money, and we built the computers in 10days and sell them for cash at the store. So that was how we ran for agood year with the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  1computer because we had nothing ourselves. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Wozniak touches on aspects of innovation that Icover in my study, such as startups being financially lean and the resistance of established firms to new approaches. Wozniak offered the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  1to his employer, Hewlett Packard (HP), and they turned him down. And, as Wozniak notes, even if HP had built his machine, it would have been too expensive. 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Computer was classic disruptive innovation. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Unfortunately, U.S. policymakers are shifting our economy away from the environment that spawned 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  and many other great tech companies. Recent federal laws have embraced subsidies and central planning over private funding and decentralized innovation. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Markkula allocated capital to Jobs and Wozniak, and in turn Wozniak has allocated his capital to many other new enterprises. It is abig mistake, as Andy Kessler notes[4], to scrap this system for atop\uc0\u8208 \u8203 down approach where the 'lobbyists allocate capital' for our technology industries.

\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0  Significantly larger displays: 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  increased the size of the display by shrinking the bezels and rounding the corners with the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 7[3]. The standard \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  model will continue to adopt the Series 7 display, which features a 20% larger screen than the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204 . 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Always-on Retina display: Introduced with the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 5 and present on every flagship 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch since, the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  will feature an always-on display that allows the display to remain dimly lit at all times, providing easy access to quick information like the time and complications.  
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  More durable hardware: Alongside a rumored "rugged" 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch set to launch this fall, the standard \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  will feature the same durable hardware as the Series 7, such as a stronger front glass and more durable aluminum models compared to the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204 . 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Ability to measure Blood Oxygen: The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  will feature a Blood Oxygen sensor, introduced with the Series 6 in 2020 and unavailable on the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204 . The sensor allows wearers to measure the amount of oxygen in their blood. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  ECG capabilities: The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  will be able to take an ECG, or an electrocardiogram, right on your wrist. This high-end health and wellness feature is not available on the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204  and has been present on 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series models since the Series 4. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Built-in temperature sensor: One new health sensor coming to the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  is the ability to measure body temperature. Rumors suggest the new sensor will not, at least at first, provide wearers a direct temperature reading of their body but may simply advise them if they may have a fever and seek medical attention. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Fast charging: The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204  does not support fast charging, and with the Series 8, customers can look forward to up to 30% faster charging alongside all-day 18 hours of battery life. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Improved optical heart sensor: The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204  features a second-generation optical heart sensor, compared to the third-generation model in the Series 7, and we expect the fourth-generation model in the upcoming Series 8. The improvements in heart sensors are likely to offer more reliable and accurate readings.  
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20  Faster performance: The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  is likely to feature a dual-core S8 SiP (system in a package), which would be faster than the dual-core S5 chip in the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204 . Customers can expect faster performance and more fluid animations as a result.  
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 If the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  is not an attractive option for current \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204  customers, it's worth noting that we are expecting an updated \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch SE\uc0\u8204  alongside the Series 8 that may offer more moderate upgrades, though there have been few rumors about specs for the new SE model. This article, "

\f2\fs20 \cf0  
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is rumored to be working on an upgraded "pro" version of the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch that will be sold alongside the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8[1] models. The 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro will feature a different design, a larger size, and a more expensive price tag. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Redesigned [2] 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 This guide aggregates everything we know about the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro, which is expected to launch in September alongside the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  and the new iPhone 14[3] models. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Design 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 While the standard \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  models are not going to get a design update, we are expecting a new look for the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman[4] has indicated that the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro will feature a design[5] that is an "evolution of the current rectangular shape." 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 There were 2021 rumors about a flat-edged design for the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch, but no such device ever materialized. The flat-edged design is not expected to be used for the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro, and so it's not going to look like those 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 7[6] mockups that we saw ahead of the Series 7 launch. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Durability. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro has also been described as a "rugged" 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch that's aimed at those who do extreme sports[7]. It will feature a casing that is more durable and better able to hold up to abuse, with the device targeted toward athletes, hikers, and others who expose their watches to more extreme conditions. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The titanium \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 7\uc0\u8204  models 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 In addition to being larger, the display will also be made from a shatter-resistant material that will provide more durability. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Casing Material 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is planning to use a new titanium metal alloy that is stronger than aluminum and better able to hold up to extreme use. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Size 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro will be larger than the current 41mm and 45mm sizes. In fact, Gurman has said that it will be a "good bit bigger" than the current 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch models and in fact so large that it may only appeal to a "subset of customers." 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The display is expected to measure in at two inches diagonally, which will provide seven percent more screen area than the 1.9-inch diagonal screen size of the 45mm \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 7\uc0\u8204  and the Series 8, as that device will feature the same casing as the Series 7. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 It is said to feature a display resolution of 410 x 502 pixels, and the extra display area could potentially be used to display extra fitness metrics on a single screen. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Battery Life 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 As the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro will be larger, it will likely fit a larger battery[8] inside to accommodate longer workout times. With a rumored low-power mode that is coming to Series 8 models, the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro could even last for multiple days before needing to be recharged. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Health Features 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Aside from a larger, more durable casing, the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro is expected to offer the same functionality as the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204 , so it will get all of the features rumored for the Series 8. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  models are rumored to be gaining a temperature sensor that will allow them to be able to determine whether a user has a higher than normal body temperature. The temperature sensor is unlikely to feature an exact temperature reading, but it will be able to show fluctuations. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Because the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch will be using skin temperature, it will not be as accurate as a thermometer that is able to monitor core body temperature. At launch, 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is likely to use this for fertility planning and monitoring. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Other Possible Features 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Rumors have indicated that the next-generation 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch and iPhone[9] models could include a car crash detection feature[10] that would use the accelerometer to detect accidents when they occur by measuring a spike in gravitational force. When a crash is detected, the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch could automatically call emergency services. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is working on an S8 chip for the \uc0\u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 8\uc0\u8204  models, but current information suggests that it won't offer much in the way of performance improvements over the S7 in the \u8204 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Series 7\uc0\u8204 . There have also been rumors of updates to activity tracking[11], though specifics are not available at this time.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Price 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 With a larger body and a titanium casing, the 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Pro will not be cheap[12]. It is expected to be priced around $900 to $999, which would make it more expensive than the current titanium 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch Edition, which is available for $849. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  will sell the

\f4\i\b \ul Apple

\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 "We are delighted to bring 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay to Malaysia, providing an easier, safer, and more secure way to pay with iPhone, 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch, iPad, and Mac. We think users will love the convenience and security of using 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay," said Jennifer Bailey, 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's vice president of 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay and

\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay with the support of the most popular banks, merchants, and our customers' favourite apps."
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Security and privacy are at the core of 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay, which features industry-leading protection of users' personal information, transaction data, and credit and debit card information. Credit and debit card numbers are not stored on device or on 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  servers; instead, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted, and securely stored in the Secure Element on the user's device, and each transaction is authorised with a one-time unique dynamic security code. 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  does not retain transaction information that can be tied back to the customer. Transactions stay between the customer, the merchant or developer, and the bank or card issuer. If a user's iPhone is lost or stolen, they can use Find My iPhone to quickly locate, lock, or suspend payments from that device.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Using 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay in stores is fast and easy. Simply hold iPhone or 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Watch near the contactless terminal, and authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID. When making purchases in Safari, customers can use 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay without having to create an account, key in a PIN, fill out lengthy forms, or repeatedly type in shipping and billing information. Every 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay purchase is authenticated with Face ID, Touch ID, or a device passcode, as well as a one-time unique dynamic security code.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Customers with Visa and Mastercard cards from banks including AmBank, Maybank, and Standard Chartered Bank can now use 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Pay, with American Express cards to be available with

\f2\fs20 \cf0  Last year's Epic Games versus 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  ruling[1] left neither side happy, with both the developer and iPhone maker filing appeals against the judgement. The appeal hearing has now been scheduled for October 21, and it looks set to be an uphill battle for 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone [2] and Epic[3] will each get only 20 minutes to make oral arguments, but we may also be hearing from the antitrust[4] division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), and potentially also an argument on behalf of 35 state attorneys general - each of which is effectively siding with Epic  
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Background 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Epic Games sued 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  for not allowing it to use its own payment platform instead of in-app purchases through the App Store[5], with 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  taking a 30% cut. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The court ruled[1]that 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  must allow developers to steer app users to external payment platforms, but concluded that the company did not meet the legal tests to be considered a monopoly - and thus did not have to permit competing app stores for iOS apps. Both 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone [6]andEpic Games[7]filed appeals on different aspects of the ruling. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Epic is appealing the ruling that the App Store is not a monopoly, arguing that there is no other way for developers to sell iPhone apps other than through 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone . The iPhone maker, in turn, is arguing that the court made a legal error[8] when considering the anti-steering issue. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The Department of Justice antitrust division filed what's known as an amicus brief - a statement from an uninvolved party which is intended to help the court reach the correct decision. Although technically neutral, labelled as 'in support of neither party,' the DOJ's submission favors Epic's argument[9] that 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  does have monopoly control of the iOS app market. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Additionally, the attorneys general of 35 US states have also joined forces to submit an amicus brief that again argues that 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  does have monopolistic powers. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Epic Games versus 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  appeal 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Foss Patents[10] reports that the appeal hearing has been scheduled for Friday, October 21. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The Ninth Circuit will hear Epic Games v. 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  App Store antitrust appeal on October 21 in San Francisco [] 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It's a cross-appeal as Epic is appealing the dismissal of its federal antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, while 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is appealing the consolation prize Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers handed Epic in the form of an anti-anti-steering injunction under California state law (Unfair Competition Law). 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 It should be noted that the site's Florian Mueller is a developer, and makes no secret of the fact that he believes 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  should lose the case. But he has argued this from legal precedent[11], rather than any feelings of his own. Mueller also points to the sloppiness of the judgement[12], as well as one absurdity within the ruling which appears to suggest the court did not understand the most fundamental of facts. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Those misconceptions culminated in a sentence according to which 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's market share in smartphones is smaller than in smartphone operating systems, though we all know that no iPhone is sold without iOS and iOS is never sold without an iPhone. 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 We may potentially hear from five different parties: 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  Epic Games The US Department of Justice A lawyer speaking for 35 state attorneys general California (speaking on a state-specific issue) 
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 However, it is not yet known whether the latter three will apply for permission to be heard. In particular, whatever the outcome of this appeal, it is certain that the losing side(s) will appeal to the Supreme Court, so the third parties may decide to wait until then. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 9to5Mac's Take 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 Anyone who predicts what will happen at the end of a court case is either brave or naive. 
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The original ruling was a compromise - one thatwe predicted[13]- and it's possible that the appeal decision will likewise be somewhere between the two positions.  
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 However, it seems unarguable that 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  has the tougher challenge here. It is not only arguing against Epic Games, but also effectively against the position stated by the Department of Justice and a whole bunch of US states. It is also flying in the face of upcoming antitrust legislation, which may eventually render the ruling here irrelevant.  
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 Two things are certain: It's going to be a tough fight, and it will eventually be decided in the US Supreme Court.

\f2\fs20 \cf0 EVERY time you charge your iPhone in 2026, 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  will match the electricity you use with locally generated wind power.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The tech giant unveiled plans to invest heavily in a North Queensland wind farm on Thursday as part of its 40th anniversary celebrations in Australia and to meet ambitious environmental targets.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The company, whose operations are already carbon neutral, has pledged to offset the use of all of its products by 2030, so "every 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  device sold will have net zero climate impact".
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  environment, policy and social initiatives vice-president Lisa Jackson, in Sydney for the announcement, said its newest investment would bring the company closer to that goal.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 "This is actually only the second project we've done where the clean energy that's going to be generated really goes to help green up our customers' use of devices," she said.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "By 2030, our goal is no matter where you are in the world, if you're charging you're not adding carbon emissions - you're climate neutral just as 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  is." 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  currently generates more than 20 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions each year - 22 per cent of which are due to customers charging their devices.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f4\i\b\fs20 \cf0 \ul \ulc0 Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's investment in Upper Burdekin Wind Farm, run by Windlab, will see electricity generated on pastoral land 65km outside of Ingham in Queensland, in an area close to the electricity network.
\f0\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\sl260\sb200\qj\partightenfactor0

\f2\fs20 \cf0 The wind farm isn't expected to be operational until 2026, with 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's investment covering enough electricity to power the equivalent of 80,000 homes, or 500 gigawatt hours a year.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 The US tech giant has also announced an investment in a wind farm in Texas, more than 2300 acres, in a project due to begin operations in late 2022. Ms Jackson said she hoped the clean energy projects helped show governments around the world what could be done as they took action to reform electricity grids.
\f0\fs24 \

\f2\fs20 "The hope is that 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone 's doing this to prime the pumps and help with the transition here in Australia, but there will be many more wind farms and solar farms that get built by developers as governments make their own pledges to cut carbon emissions," she said. 
\f4\i\b \ul Apple
\f2\i0\b0 \ulnone  chief executive Tim Cook said the company's latest investment in Australia was designed to celebrate its 40th anniversary of local operations.
